<h1>Sex Work: The Perks & Drawbacks</h1>
<p>Just to be clear: I am writing this book for people who are interested in learning more about the inner workings of sex work, whether out of curiosity or because they are considering giving it a try for themselves.</p>
<p>I will say that my own experience working as an escort for over ten years has been very positive and I have no regrets. I found the work very rewarding and exciting, for the most part.</p>
<p>I also made some of my best friends in life through my work as an escort.</p>
<p>But please remember to be prudent when reading this, as I am only one person who is also a sex worker. You can't assume that my experiences are the same as that of other sex workers and you shouldn't assume that yours would be the same either.</p>
<p>Please do not use this book as your sole research on the subject if you are seriously considering doing it yourself. It is always unwise to base any major decision on the advice of one person or by only looking at something from one angle.</p>
<p>That being said, let's take a look at the most attractive perks of sex work.</p>

<h2>Amount of Freedom</h2>
<p>This one is pretty predictable. It's the same reason why starting your own business or being a self-made entrepreneur is so alluring to most people – you get to work for yourself.</p>
<p>That means setting your own schedule, choosing your own hours, taking whatever time off that you want and can afford to, the ability to pick and choose who you work with, deciding what services you offer, and making whatever rates you set for your time.</p>
<p>Having this much control over the work you do makes escorting pretty intriguing to most people.</p>
<p>However, a lot of people fail to realize that having so much control demands certain personality traits and skills in order to succeed.</p>
<p>For example, I happen to be terrible when it comes to managing my time and I have little self-discipline when it comes to structuring my day or sticking to plans.</p>
<p>If I had been stronger in these areas, it would have helped me do even better as an escort.</p>
<p>Managing my spending and sticking to a budget are also skills I don't really have, and that hurt me as well.</p>
<p>If you are like me in these ways, you may still make a lot of money working as an escort, but you also will risk getting burnt out on it and it may end up feeling like you are maintaining rather than thriving.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you kick ass when it comes to budgeting and have tons of self-discipline, then escorting can literally make things possible for you that never were before in your life.</p>
<p>You can pay your college tuition without getting swamped in student loan debts.</p>
<p>You can pay with cash to buy yourself a new car.</p>
<p>You can make a down payment on a house.</p>
<p>You can travel to anywhere in the world you want to.</p>
<p>You can provide for your children and family.</p>
<p>The list of possibilities is endless.</p>

<h2>The Money</h2>
<p>Yes, the money is a huge perk of working as an escort.</p>
<p>That much is hard to deny.</p>
<p>Even if the minimum wage is raised to $15 in every US state, that still means that bagging groceries at Walmart 40 hours per week will earn you $2,400 per month to live on.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like enough to me, especially if you have kids or other people who are dependent on you for financial help.</p>
<p>In contrast, if you set your rates to $200 per hour and offer your services as an escort (assuming those services include the basics, like intercourse and oral sex) then you can make that same amount in one 12-hour week.</p>
<p>If you work 12 hours per week for an entire month, you would earn a total of $96,000.</p>
<p>Have I ever done that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But would it have been possible?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Working as an escort for twelve hours every week may quickly exhaust you.</p>
<p>So let's look at another scenario which is more realistic.</p>
<p>Let's say you only work <b><u>ONE</u></b> hour per day, 7 days of the week.</p>
<p>That's one client or two at most per day (if you get two half-hour bookings instead of one for an hour).</p>
<p>That would leave you with $1,400 per week and $5,600 per month.</p>
<p>Have I done that?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>The best part about this "1 hour a day" plan is that it's easy to do even if you currently have another day job.</p>
<p>Most people can spare an hour or two after work.</p>
<p>But imagine what an extra $67,200 per year would do to improve your financial situation.</p>

<h2>Under the Table Income</h2>
<p>Since escorting is a type of work most women (or men) choose to keep private, that basically means the pay is under the table. </p>
<p>As in, you can get away with not paying income taxes on the money you earn from escorting.</p>
<p>Of course, both prostitution and tax evasion are definitely illegal in the United States.</p>
<p>And while there is most certainly a down side to engaging in illegal activities, there are also many benefits such as getting to pocket 100% of your escorting income.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Debt</h2>
<p>One of the most empowering aspects of making this kind of money is that it can help you to reduce or eliminate any existing debts you have and can allow you to continue living debt-free in the future if you play your cards right.</p>
<p>Who needs a credit card when you can pay cash for everything?</p>
<p>Who needs to take out a loan for something when you have so much cash saved away?</p>
<p>Of course, if it's important to you to maintain good credit or if you want to purchase something like a home, you will probably want a couple of credit card accounts in good standing and escorting will make keeping those balances paid every month a piece of cake.</p>
<p>You get the idea – you can pretty much set yourself up to do anything for the future.</p>

<h2>Fun & Exciting (Most of the Time)</h2>
<p>More often than not, I would describe my work as an escort as both fun and exciting.</p>
<p>Of course, no job is both of those things all the time. That's unrealistic.</p>
<p>The most important question you need to honestly answer is this:</p>
<p>Are you totally okay and comfortable with the thought of meeting strangers and having casual sex with them in exchange for money?</p>
<p>Because that is essentially what the job involves.</p>
<p>If your answer is "no!" or even "maybe" then I don't recommend you become a sex worker.</p>
<p>If your answer is "hell yes!" or "I can get paid for that?!"</p>
<p>Then it may be right for you. ;-)</p>

<h2>Professional Networking</h2>
<p>The cool thing about escorting is the variety of different people you have the opportunity to meet and build relationships with.</p>
<p>This comes in handy in tons of different ways.</p>
<p>For example, I had a client who was a mechanic and had a shop at his house.</p>
<p>He was very helpful for finding cheap cars and then fixing them up for me in exchange for a couple meetings.</p>
<p>I've had clients who were chiropractors, lawyers, nurses, insurance agents and a long list of other occupations, all of which can be highly useful to you in certain situations.</p>
<p>Now that we considered some of the perks, let's get real about some of the drawbacks so that you have a balanced picture and can make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>The Legality</h2>
<p>Unless you live in one of the few counties in the state of Nevada where prostitution is legal, then you can safely assume that this type of work is not exactly legal.</p>
<p>Even in Nevada, it's not legal to work independently as a prostitute. </p>
<p>You are required to work in a brothel, where you can't refuse customers and are forced to stay at the brothel where you work sometimes for months without leaving at all.</p>
<p>Not only that, but women working as prostitutes in Nevada brothels are sometimes required to register their vehicles with the sheriff's office in their county as well.</p>
<p>Why so controlling?</p>
<p>Because they don't want them bringing any diseases back to the brothel and infecting their customers.</p>
<p>Obviously they are tested regularly as well, but those prostitutes give up a significant amount of their freedom in exchange for working "legally."</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I think that sounds more like sexual slavery than it does sexually empowered and in control.</p>
<p>The legal way isn't always the best or even the "right" way.</p>

<h2>Social Stigma</h2>
<p>The social stigma attached to sex work is probably one of the worst drawbacks, in my personal experience. </p>
<p>If I accomplish anything before dying, I would like for it to be making a difference in the public's perception of sex work. I know, I've set the bar pretty high.</p>
<p>But I think it's possible.</p>
<p>If you want to get an idea of how much damage the stigma attached to sex work goes, consider this.</p>
<p>There is a serial killer who has murdered as many as 17 sex workers and dumped all of their bodies along the beach in Long Island (NY).  Most of them were young women in their twenties who advertised on Craigslist when they still allowed erotic services. </p>
<p>There are no current suspects in this case.</p>
<p>When the family of one of the victims called police to report her missing, they told her "she's a hooker, she's where she wants to be" and refused to file a report because she hadn't been missing long enough.</p>
<p>This perception of sex workers as somehow being "damaged goods" has got to be obliterated.</p>
<p>Everyone has sex. We all enjoy it under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>So what's with the heinous attitude some people have towards those who make a living this way?</p>
<p>I don't fully know the answer to that.</p>
<p>If you plan on being "out" about your work, just be prepared to weather the storm.</p>
<p>It demands a certain level of confidence and an attitude of "I don't take shit from anyone, so don't fucking go there!"</p>
<p>At least, that's how I approached it.</p>
<p>I mean, try to imagine that the bodies of 17 young women in their twenties were discovered <b><u>ANYWHERE</u></b> in the United States and they were University students being targeted instead of prostitutes. </p>
<p>How long do you think it would take to hunt that bastard down and hold him accountable?</p>
<p>How much news coverage do you think that story would get?</p>
<p>How much effort would law enforcement put into solving those cases?</p>
<p>It makes me sick.</p>
<p>If you have another job already, consider yourself lucky. You can just keep the escorting private and to yourself, and you don't really have to tell many other people about it.</p>
<p>I didn't have that option. </p>
<p>I worked solely as an escort for most of the time I was in the business.</p>
<p>Yes, it makes it awkward to talk about the kind of work you do with strangers, people you have just met, your hairdresser, acquaintances, friends, family, significant others, basically everyone.</p>
<p>But we'll talk some about how to handle that later on in this guide.</p>
<p>For now, just suffice to say that there is a good chance most of your friends and family will not be "supportive" of your choice to engage in sex work.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to tell them is ultimately up to you and only you know what is right for you in your situation. </p>

<h2>Friends & Family</h2>
<p>How you handle your family and close friends is a very personal decision. </p>
<p>There are more variables to consider for some people than others.</p>
<p>For instance, you may have children of your own who you have to think about when it comes to who you tell about your work as an escort.</p>
<p>Luckily, I didn't have any extra responsibilities or obligations that made this a complicated issue for me.</p>
<p>I decided to be open and honest about what I did, even with my family who mostly does not approve. </p>
<p>My grandparents raised me and they are very old-fashioned.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of just how old-fashioned we're talking, my grandfather expected my grandmother to be a virgin when they got married, even though he wasn't one himself.</p>
<p>I guess being born in the 1940's means you didn't exactly grow up in the most feminist positive generation. </p>
<p>Also, when my mother came home with a newly inked tattoo on her arm at the age of fifteen, my grandfather informed her that "only sailors and hookers have tattoos," and asked her which one she was.</p>
<p>Ugh, I know.</p>
<p>I love my grandparents dearly, but they do not approve of my work as an escort or most of my other lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>BUT...they still love me.</p>
<p>We mostly have to avoid talking about that stuff because it just upsets them and I get pretty heated and defensive about it to.</p>
<p>So we just talk about other things, and that's okay.</p>
<p>There is no need to push the topic and make them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>If something is said that touches on it, or offends me…then I usually say something, but that's about as far as I insist on taking it.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, I'm not close with any of my other blood relatives and my grandparents live 100 miles from the city I live in, so it's not a huge or often encountered problem for me in my everyday life.</p>

<h2>Risky & Dangerous</h2>
<p>We've touched on the dangers and risks involved with working as an escort, but it's one of the most important things to consider and weigh so let's delve into that a little deeper.</p>
<p>The Long Island serial killer is still out there somewhere.</p>
<p>And it's not as if he is the first such murderer to specifically target prostitutes. </p>
<p>The most infamous and well-known example of such a serial killer is (of course) Jack the Ripper, who was also never caught.</p>
<p>Gary Ridgeway, better known as the "Green River Killer," murdered upwards of 70 women throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most of whom were prostitutes he picked up off the streets and strangled.</p>
<p>These are only a few examples, sadly.</p>
<p>This is why walking the streets is too dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>Does this mean you will meet the same fate as these victims if you choose to engage in sex work?</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>I'm still here to tell the tale, right?</p>
<p>All of my clients have been respectful, conscious of my health and safety and have been mostly gentlemen. </p>
<p>But it's important to know the risks before you decide if something is right for you, which is why we are not focusing only on my experience. </p>

<h1>Posting Escort Ads Online</h1>
<p>When you have never written an ad offering escort services, it's difficult to write the first word or have a sense of what is allowed and what is against the rules.</p>
<p>This will obviously depend somewhat on where you decide to post your ads.</p>
<p>When I started escorting, I was posting ads on Craigslist.</p>
<p>But they have since removed the "erotic services" section that once existed.</p>
<p>Since then, Backpage.com has mostly taken their place as the only popular classified ads site that allows escort advertising.</p>
<p>For a long time, the big difference between Backpage and Craigslist was that it cost money to post escort ads on Backpage.</p>
<p>However, since VISA and Mastercard recently began blocking payments to the site (after being pressured by some nutcase lobbyist) Backpage has made escort ads free to post for the time being.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with posting ads on Backpage, I've done it myself  here and there. But I can't say it gets anywhere near the results that Craigslist did years ago, before I ever used Backpage.</p>
<p>A better alternative is to find escort review boards where you can register a provider account.</p>
<p>These are preferable because it is possible to screen new clients much easier, get reviews from clients you have already seen and it's just generally safer and the responses to your ads tend to be higher in quality.</p>
<p>One of the boards I use to post ads is TNABoard.com, which includes forums for a long list of major cities across several different states.</p>
<p>If your city is listed there, I recommend signing up with them and posting some ads there to see what kind of results you get.</p>
<p>Of course, free ads have some rules and limitations.</p>
<p>You can't post every day, unless you upgrade and pay to post more often.</p>
<p>Also, paying for upgraded advertising is kind of pain in the ass right now since they have encountered the same problem with accepting credit card payments as Backpage.</p>
<p>I believe currently you have to purchase Bitcoin to upgrade ads on TNABoard.com.</p>
<p>At any rate, the most important elements of your ad are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Title/Headline</li>
<li>Rates</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Contact Info</li>
</ol>
<p>Back in the Craigslist era, the rules were much more relaxed about how you could word things in your ads.</p>
<p>However, a lot has changed since then and here are some tips for writing ads on TNABoard (and most other boards/sites like it):</p>
<ol><li>List rates for <b><u>TIME</u></b> only!</li><p>You can list an hourly rate and a half hour rate, an overnight rate, whatever amount of time you are offering. But do <u><b>NOT</u></b> list prices for specific services that include sexual acts, as this is <b><u>NOT</u></b> allowed most places where escorts post ads.</p>
<li>Leave out the common acronyms.</li><p> Most sites have stopped allowing ads to contain common escorting acronyms such as "GFE" or "BBBJ," so please be aware that I'm including their definitions because clients will still use them when contacting you and you will need to understand what they mean.</p>
<li>Leave out the word "sex" or any direct verbs of a sexual nature.</li> <p>Backpage.com is especially strict about this in ad titles and the body of your ads as well.</p>
<li>Include some high quality photos of yourself.</li><p> A face shot and a full body are best to include in the ad. If you are concerned about being recognized or having your identity revealed, it's fine to blur the face and include two full body shots instead.</p>
<li>Include your contact details for clients to get in touch.</li><p> If you don't want to use the same phone number you use for personal stuff, sign up for a free Google Voice number and they will give you a new number you can use which will forward to the same phone.</p>
</ol>
<p>Another good site for posting classified ads is SkipTheGames.com</p>
<p>Also, create a profile at Slixa.com too.</p>

<h1>Common Escorting Acronyms & Terms</h1>
<p>While you shouldn't use these in your ads and you need to be careful about attaching specific dollar amounts to any acronyms or commonly known "code words" when discussing things with a new client, you should be aware of what these mean because you are likely to encounter them all at some point. </p>
<p>This is only a handful of the most often encountered and widely recognized terms and acronyms, there are dozens of others too.</p>
<h3>GFE</h3>
<p><i>Girlfriend Experience: intimate-style sessions and allowing open-mouth kissing as part of the encounter.</i></p>
<h3>PSE</h3>
<p><i>Porn Star Experience: the opposite of GFE, can include any sexual acts considered more "hardcore" or "fetish-oriented."</i></p>
<h3>Spinner</h3>
<p>Term used to describe escorts who are thin or "skinny."</p>
<h3>BBW</h3>
<p>Big Beautiful Woman: opposite of a Spinner. Indicates a voluptuous, curvy or heavyset escort.</p>
<h3>Hobbyist</h3>
<p>Term used for clients of an escort.</p>
<h3>BBJ or BBBJ</h3>
<p>Bare Back Blow Job: providing oral sex without requiring the use of a condom</p>
<h3>DATY</h3>
<p>Dining at the Y: allowing clients to perform oral sex on you</p>
<h3>Full Service</h3>
<p>Vaginal sexual intercourse with clients.</p>
<h3>Greek</h3>
<p>Anal sex with clients.</p>
<h3>French or French Lessons</h3>
<p>Another way of saying "blowjobs"</p>
<h3>"Untranslated" French Lessons</h3>
<p>Alternative way of saying blowjobs without a condom</p>
<h3>Russian</h3>
<p>Tit-fucking</p>
<h3>ATM</h3>
<p>Ass to Mouth</p>
<h3>Aunt Flo</h3>
<p>Refers to an escort menstruating</p>
<h3>CIM</h3>
<p>Cum in Mouth</p>
<h3>COF</h3>
<p>Cum on Face</p>
<h3>DFK</h3>
<p>Deep French Kissing</p>
<h3>MSOG</h3>
<p>Multiple Shots on Goal: allowing a client to cum multiple times in a single session</p>
<p>On TNABoard.com, you are not allowed to list which services you provide in your actual ads. However, you can in your profile. They have a long list of different activities that you can choose from and new clients can view them there.</p>
<p>So if someone is asking questions about services, tell them to check your profile on the board instead of discussing the details with them.</p>

<mbp:pagebreak />
<a name="part3" />

<h1>Creating Your Escort "Menu"</h1>
<p>At some point during this whole process, you will have to decide which services you wish to provide for your escorting clients.</p>
<p>Here is the best part about your menu offering: you <u><b>NEVER</u></b> have to offer <u><b>ANYTHING</u></b> you would rather not or that makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p><u><b>ONLY</u></b> provide the services you are truly comfortable with, because I promise there are plenty of guys out there who are looking for those exact things and will happily pay you whatever rates you decide to charge for them.</p>
<p>While the most popular and in-demand style of services is GFE (in my experience) that doesn't mean you have to offer these types of sessions.</p>
<p>Guys will still call, you will still get tons of bookings and you won't have anything to worry about as long as you make your clients feel good and leave happy.</p>
<p>Having boundaries professionally when it comes to sex is just as acceptable as having them personally with intimate partners. No one should ever pressure you to compromise on what you are okay with doing and what you are not.</p>
<p>Also, if new clients try to ask about BBFS (bareback full service) you should be aware that they are asking you to forgo your safety for their own pleasure.</p>
<p>I wouldn't take too kindly to this.</p>
<p>Some guys will offer you more money to go without a condom, but you risk contracting STD's and it's highly unsafe.</p>
<p>As far as blowjobs go, you can also require that your clients wear a condom for that too.</p>
<p>You wouldn't be the first escort to have that policy.</p>
<p>It's ultimately your call, but do not allow offers of extra money cloud your judgement or sacrifice your comfort for any reason.</p>

<h2>The "Girlfriend Experience" Fantasy</h2>
<p>One of the most often encountered acronyms in online escort communities and review boards is GFE, which stands for "girlfriend experience."</p>
<p>It's also the most often encountered fantasy, in my own experience. </p>
<p>But what exactly does it mean in the context of escorting, and why is it in such high demand?</p>
<p>Essentially, GFE translates to having sex the same way you would if you were dating someone and had an intimate relationship with them.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why it is as popular as it undeniably is.</p>
<p>The first is that guys want the sexual benefits of a relationship without having to take on the rest of the responsibilities and baggage, so to speak.</p>
<p>The second is that many escorts do not allow the types of intimacy involved with GFE.</p>
<p>If GFE were to be defined by a single act, it would be French kissing.</p>
<p>That is the big distinction, as odd as that may seem.</p>
<p>A large percentage of erotic providers do not allow open-mouthed kissing, as they reserve that type of intimacy for their own personal relationships.</p>
<p>I've always found that more than a little strange, personally.</p>
<p>The opposite of GFE is PSE, which stands for "Porn Star Experience."</p>
<p>Contrary to what many would guess, this is by far the less common request in my experience.</p>
<p>It still puzzles me how an escort could be willing to perform the acts involved in PSE and then refuse to do something as innocent as making out.</p>
<p>If you're going to put your mouth on someone's genitals, why on Earth would you have some rule against locking lips with them?!</p>
<p>I will say that my willingness to provide GFE for my clients did create some confusion and emotional attachment for some. </p>
<p>The big issue that tends to come up when you provide a convincing "girlfriend experience" for your clients is that they end up falling for the act and mistake it as genuine.</p>
<p>They forget that you are there because they are paying you for your time.</p>
<p>They develop actual feelings for you and emotions become strong, which is usually a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>Of course, some providers address this issue by simply charging an extra amount for GFE services.</p>
<p>This can serve as a professional way to keep clients in check and makes it more difficult for them to become swept away and start thinking their feelings are reciprocated. </p>
<p>When I first began working as an escort, I figured that any women who had "no kissing" rules must have some emotional issue with the type of work they were doing, which meant they probably shouldn’t be a sex worker.</p>
<p>However, with the experience I have today, I can see why keeping things professional makes sense for some people more than others. It's just a simple way of establishing clear boundaries between your personal life and the client-provider relationship you have with your clients.</p>
<p>Being laid back about my time spent with clients, in combination with my intimate style of providing services led to more than my fair share of awkward situations where clients expressed a desire to have an actual relationship with me.</p>
<p>This never really ended well.</p>
<p>Either they bit off more than they could chew, thinking they could handle the insecurities that naturally arise when dating a sex worker or because ultimately, I was not attracted to them and they ended up feeling rejected and hurt.</p>
<p>As always, the older the client, the more mature they tend to be about things. If they have been married for many years, you have even less to worry about. </p>
<p>These clients appreciate the intimacy offered by GFE, while also having no desire to pack their bags and abandon the life they have established with their families. </p>
<p>As my husband used to joke, the real "girlfriend experience" is more like dropping her off at the mall with your credit card and then NOT getting laid afterwards.</p>

<h1>Common Client Requests</h1>
<p>During your career as an escort, you are likely to encounter several common requests from new clients. The ones included in this section are simply those which I have received numerous times over the years, so your experience may be different.</p>
<p>Of course, you can choose not to cater to certain fetishes if you would rather not or don’t feel comfortable with what they involve.</p>
<p>For me, I don't cater to clients who have a foot fetish. I just think it's odd and I can't take it seriously, so I usually tell them I'm not the right provider for them to see.</p>
<p>I've seriously been asked for photos of my feet, up close shots of my toes and asked what kind of "arches" I had…</p>
<p>My response was, "Yeah, I have no idea."</p>
<p>It's nothing personal, I don't judge anyone for a fetish as long as it doesn't cause harm to any unwilling participant or anyone incapable of consent for any reason.</p>
<p>It's just not my thing, so I choose not to see those clients.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing with any type of service or fetish if you prefer.</p>
<p>Here are a few common requests you are likely to get if you work as an escort.</p>

<h2>Fetish Wear</h2>
<p>Lots of guys have serious fetishes for women's lingerie, stockings, garters and clothes like that. While most don't want you to show up at the doorstep wearing this stuff (at least not without something over it) they go crazy for it once you arrive and change into it.</p>
<p>Some guys are very specific about colors, materials and styles they prefer. If they are particular about any of those things, they will likely be specific in their requests.</p>
<p>I am not personally much of a lingerie person, so I don't usually have that kind of "frilly" stuff in my closet, but most clients who wanted me to wear something like that had no problem at all picking something they liked up on the way to meet me and then providing it for me.</p>
<p>So if you don't have that kind of stuff but are not opposed to wearing it, just tell them to pick something they really like and you'll be more than happy to model it for them during your session.</p>

<h2>Role Play</h2>
<p>Role playing is another common request, but usually it's more of an "in the moment" type of thing that is revealed about a client than it is pre-arranged.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that this is because it seems forced or less authentic if the whole thing is too "staged."</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but that's my take on it.</p>
<p>I once had a new client who I had never seen before who apparently had a fetish about watching black men with larger genitals than him having sex with his girlfriends.</p>
<p>So he just kind of went into this little fantasy about that, which took me a few minutes to even figure out since he just started in on it by himself.</p>
<p>I thought it was kind of odd and funny, but I did my best to play along and answer his questions or offer positive reinforcement when he would say something he obviously thought was hot.</p>
<p>If someone wants to role play with you, just be sure it's something you are not creeped out by and never be afraid to bring a session to a screeching halt if something is making you feel uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Video Taping Sessions</h2>
<p>Occasionally, a client will probably ask if it's okay for them to record their session with you. Whether or not you allow this is totally up to you and if it makes you uncomfortable or concerned, just tell them you would rather not and you are a bit camera shy.</p>
<p>Don't allow first time clients to record their sessions with you, as you just have no trust established with them that early on and you don't know what their intentions are so better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>If you've been seeing a client over a period of time and you trust them, then you probably have nothing to worry about if you let them record a session.</p>

<h2>Trading or Bartering</h2>
<p>About as often, you will probably be asked to trade services for something other than cash. Personally, I've traded for everything from cars and drugs to laptops and smartphones.</p>
<p>Again, only you can decide what is acceptable or inappropriate for yourself. </p>
<p>But there is the potential here to pick up some pretty cool stuff every once in a while. Just be careful with new clients and make sure you are given the item first or they may be trying to rip you off.</p>

<h1>Setting Your Escorting Rates</h1>

<p>If you are brand new to escorting, you probably have no idea how to set your hourly rate. </p>
<p>I know I certainly didn't.</p>
<p>My advice is to just spend some time browsing the ads on Backpage.com and TNABoard.com, as well as other similar sites.</p>
<p>Look for other providers close to your age and get an idea of what the average hourly rate is among that demographic.</p>
<p>Of course, you can ultimately choose to set your rates to whatever amount you feel is appropriate. If you do not agree with the rates you see being posted on sites by other escorts, that's fine too.</p>
<p>It's your call.</p>
<p>Of course, you always have the option and freedom to run "specials" or other limited time deals if you aren't getting enough responses to your ads and you suspect it may be due to the rates you are listing.</p>
<p>It's common for escorts to also run specials for "quickie" sessions which come at a premium rate.</p>
<p>For example, an escort may have an hourly rate of $250 and she might run a special for 15 minute "quickie" sessions at a rate of $100.</p>
<p>$100 is a lot less and there will be a greater number of clients who can afford the 15 minute meeting than the full hour.</p>
<p>Also, $100 is damn good for 15 minutes of your time.</p>
<p>Besides, most guys don't need much longer than that anyway (just keeping it real here).</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Handling Payments as an Escort</h2>
<p>Once you have decided on the rates you will be charging for your time, you will need also to consider how you will handle receiving payments from your clients.</p>
<p>The most common and widespread practice in place for the actual exchange of money is the white envelope.</p>
<p>What this means is that when you arrive for a session with a client, they will have a white envelope with the cash inside it sitting out on a table in the room where they greet you. </p>
<p>They usually try to put it somewhere very easy to spot, so that you don't have to ask about money and they don't have to say anything about it either.</p>
<p>This is done as a safety measure since discussing dollar amounts in direct exchange for sexual acts is how police bust people for prostitution as well as soliciting.</p>
<p>Collecting and discussing payment is really only an issue the first time you meet with a client you have never seen before.</p>
<p>This is always the riskiest type of meeting and you should expect the client to be just as nervous as you are feeling about it.</p>
<p>You are both vulnerable in the same ways.</p>
<p>He is worried that paying you up front may result in a cash and dash experience, which is essentially the equivalent of him having sex with you and then leaving and refusing to pay you.</p>
<p>Nobody likes being ripped off and so you will have to figure out some way that you can meet each other half way.</p>
<p>If a new client is trying to ask you specific questions about how much you charge before meeting with you, hang up and block the number they are calling from.</p>
<p>At best, he's a clueless newbie and has no idea what he's doing or why it's not appropriate.</p>
<p>At worst, he's law enforcement trying to set a trap for you.</p>
<p>I know this because my mother was arrested for "intent to commit prostitution" after discussing specific amounts over the phone with a man who turned out to be a police officer.</p>
<p>Your rates belong in your online ads, and they are listed only for your time and nothing else.</p>
<p>Therefore, a new client should never have any excuse for having to ask you about this since all the information can be found in the ad he is responding to.</p>

<h1>Incall vs. Outcall Sessions</h1><p>Another detail to work out if you plan on escorting is where you will meet with your clients.</p>
<p>In the escorting community, the term "incall" refers to clients coming to meet you at a location you provide for the session.</p>
<p>This can be your own residence, a hotel room or any other private place you can host.</p>
<p>Alternatively, "outcall" generally means you travel to the client and they host the session instead.</p>
<p>Be wary of meeting with new clients at hotels without a meet and greet or provider references, as most sting operations by law enforcement take place at hotels where escorts are lured and then arrested. </p>
<p>If you are going to offer incall, then you need a private space that is safe for hosting sessions. If you live alone and have sufficient privacy, using your home is certainly fine.</p>
<p>If you live in an apartment, it's riskier and should probably be avoided unless your particular setup has enough privacy to make it viable.</p>
<p>You don't want to attract any unwanted attention or have any nosy neighbors or property managers taking notice of all the traffic and different guys who are dropping in for short visits throughout the day.</p>
<p>This sends up red flags and creates suspicions that you need to do your best to avoid.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest benefit to offering incall is that you save a lot of time you would otherwise spend travelling to your clients.</p>
<p>You save a lot of time, actually.</p>
<p>After a session is over, you can tell your next client to head over and then jump in the shower and be ready by the time they arrive instead of having to drive to their house after you get out.</p>
<p>It might not seem significant, but it eats up more time than you might think it would.</p>
<p>Another option is to rent a motel room and work out of there so you can have clients come to you.</p>
<p>But the same issues exist with that as do with working out of an apartment.</p>
<p>In fact, it's probably even riskier at a motel because the management keep a closer watch over the place, some have policies regarding visitors to a room, and you are more likely to be noticed and/or draw attention there than at an apartment complex where you live.</p>
<p>If you choose to go this route, try finding a motel 6 or something similar that has outside entry to the rooms. As in, you do not have to enter the main building and go through a lobby in order to enter the rooms.</p>
<p>These are much easier to work from without being noticed or raising any concerns.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you rented the room with your ID, your real name is attached to it and if the police are called for any reason or someone reports suspicious activity in your room number, you could be implicating yourself in ways that are not worth the risk.</p>
<p>Another option that is particularly suitable for "quickies" or clients who are just looking for blowjobs is to offer car dates.</p>
<p>This is just what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Typically, the client will pick you up and you will find a quiet spot where you can pull off the road and quickly take care of business, so to speak.</p>
<p>It's up to you what you feel comfortable doing, so use your first instincts when it comes to choosing where have sessions with your clients.</p>

<h1>Common Escorting Mistakes to Avoid</h1>
<p>In the ten years I've worked as an escort, many clients have shared interesting stories about their encounters with other women in the business.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard to quickly see some definite trends among their stories and it painted a pretty clear picture of the things you should <u><b>NOT</u></b> do when escorting.</p>

<h2>Being Too Mechanical</h2>
<p>This is actually the most common complaint I hear from clients about the women they hire as escorts. I'm not sure how this one manages to escape so many escorts, but it's always seemed like a no-brainer to me.</p>
<p>Putting yourself in the client's place, you should be able to understand why having a bad attitude would kind of kill the whole mood.</p>
<p>When you are paying for a person's time, you expect them to be present with you and in the moment. </p>
<p>Not looking at the clock every few minutes and acting like they'd rather be somewhere else.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean you should allow your clients to take advantage of your time, however. </p>
<p>It's okay to be firm about sticking to schedule, but most clients in my experience will reward you for losing track of time and just enjoying yourself.</p>

<h2>Wearing Hooker Clothes to a Client's House</h2>
<p>This is a big <u><b>NO</u></b>.</p>
<p>Even guys who have fetishes for "hooker clothes" prefer that you do not show up at their homes wearing any.</p>
<p>If you want to dress racy, pack the clothes along with you to your appointment and change into them after arriving.</p>
<p>Or, if your client is coming to you, just change into your costume before they get there and they will be happy as can be.</p>
<p>But I've never once met a client who appreciated an escort drawing negative attention to their doorstep.</p>
<p>Many of them wish to keep a low profile and would rather their neighbors didn't catch a glimpse of someone who looks like a prostitute entering their residence.</p>
<p>Just wear your casual, everyday clothes when you show up at a client's house. Be discreet.</p>

<h2>Lurking Drivers or Other Men</h2>
<p>Most clients are wary of having an escort to their house if she has a "driver" or any other type of male who is present or lingering nearby.</p>
<p>Some girls prefer to have a male driver who can watch their back and go looking for them if they don't return when they are supposed to.</p>
<p>But clients get scared away easily by this, so just be aware.</p>
<p>I had a driver multiple times throughout my career as an escort and I usually just had them drop me off a block away from the client's house and then walked the rest of the way, to make them feel better.</p>
<p>Drivers also attract unwanted attention if they are parked in the same place while they wait for you, so make sure they are leaving once you have been dropped off and call them to come pick you up when your session is over.</p>
<p>Part of the concern is having another person they don't know who is aware of their address and this can help to eliminate some of the worries they typically have.</p>
<p>If you think a new client may be asking about whether you have a driver because he is unsafe or may cause harm to you, <u><b>DO NOT</u></b> see him.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>It is never worth the risk.</p>

<h2>Bait and Switch</h2>
<p>I've heard some pretty awful horror stories about escorts who have pulled what's known as a "bait and switch" on some of my clients.</p>
<p>This is basically the equivalent of "item not as described" when reviewing physical products.</p>
<p>Usually it happens when an escort uses extremely outdated photos of herself from years ago, or photos that are not of her at all!</p>
<p>Always use current and up to date photos of yourself for all of your ads.</p>
<p>Make sure the photos provide a realistic idea of what clients can expect you to look like when you show up.</p>
<p>My mother used to be horrible when it came to this.</p>
<p>She used photos that were from five years prior and were taken from flattering angles, distorting what she really looked like and this resulted in more than one client turning her down when she showed up.</p>
<p>I had a hard time feeling much sympathy for her because it was a problem that could easily be avoided, if she were just more straightforward and honest in her ads.</p>
<p>No one likes ordering something that looks great in the photos online and then looks totally different (and shittier) when it shows up in the mail, right?</p>
<p>Don’t ruin your day and someone else's too.</p>

<h2>The Agency Upsell Move</h2>
<p>Last minute "upsells" are typical when hiring girls who work for escorting agencies, which explains the association here.</p>
<p>At least in that situation, the agency has to make their cut and you can't really blame them for that, right?</p>
<p>But if you are working independently (which I would strongly suggest you do) then there should be no extra or additional charges for anything that you led a client to believe was included in your rate.</p>
<p>The last thing a guy wants to hear the moment before he thinks you are about to go down on him is that it will cost him an extra $50 unless he wraps it up.</p>
<p>Least sexy thing you could possibly say and at the worst possible time, too.</p>

<h1>Setting Selection Criteria for New Clients</h1>
<p>Next, you should decide what your selection criteria for clients will be.</p>
<p>You can designate yourself as either newbie-friendly or require that all new clients have references from other providers and be established reviewers on an escort review board.</p>
<p>Choose whichever you are comfortable with, obviously.</p>
<p>I've noticed that many escorts also have age requirements. Usually they give preference to older gentlemen and don't see men younger than 30 or 35.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: that age range is more serious, less flaky and comes with less drama most of the time, including in my own experience.</p>
<p>You don't have to have age requirements, but it's something to think about since many escorts think this is an important distinction.</p>
<p>I was pretty shocked and appalled when I first found out that some escorts refuse to see men of certain races and ethnicities. This to me seems grossly unreasonable, and I've seen clients of pretty much every race under the sun and there has been no reason to treat any of them differently, in my experience.</p>
<p>You should always do what feels right to you though, my opinion isn't what matters when it comes to who you choose to see and who you don't.</p>
<p>On the topic of age differences, let's talk a little about the biggest differences between younger clients (18-29) and older clients (30+).</p>

<h2>Younger vs. Older Clients</h2>
<p>Younger clients have a tendency to get carried away more easily and more often than their older and more experienced counterparts.</p>
<p>This is why many escorts require their clients to be 30 or older.</p>
<p>It's no big secret that guys tend to mature emotionally much later than girls do and when you throw sex into the mix, hormones go haywire and things can quickly escalate into more drama than you signed up for.</p>
<p>Trust me, I've had plenty of it myself over the years with more than a few different clients who were mostly under thirty.</p>
<p>Younger guys are often bachelors and this naturally makes them intrigued by the thought of "dating" you or having a "real" romantic or intimate relationship with you.</p>
<p>They are available and they enjoy sex with you, so that kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>If they perceive you as also being available, they will probably try to pursue you and this is why it's important to be clear about boundaries and if you are not receptive to the idea of dating a client, make that abundantly clear right from the start.</p>
<p>This won't always totally deter them from trying to change your mind, but it does help to discourage them from setting unrealistic expectations or misreading your signals and then being disappointed when things don't turn out how they had hoped.</p>
<p>Always be consistent. </p>
<p>Don't tell a client you are taken and not currently interested in a relationship with anyone when they ask you one day and then flirt with them when you know they are interested the next.</p>
<p>This is a recipe for trouble and you shouldn't ask for it.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that when emotions run high, people tend to do dumb things and lapses in good judgment are more likely and common.</p>
<p>Flirting and playfully misleading is one thing, but you never know when that can go wrong and pose a threat to your safety so don't be careless in this area.</p>
<p>Young guys often have strange self-righteous fantasies of being your Richard Gere, or as I like to call them, "white knight," the generous dude who sweeps you off your feet and saves you from having to "sell your body to survive."</p>
<p>Enter sigh and epic eye roll here.</p>
<p>Don't buy into this load of crap please.</p>
<p>Put them in their places when they are rude or insulting in this kind of way.</p>
<p>Demand the respect that you deserve and never hesitate to simply not see someone who offends you again.</p>
<p>It's not like you have to, there are enough clients out there who are respectful and will pay you, so don't put up with jerks or assholes. Since it's unnecessary, you will only be losing respect for yourself by continuing to see guys like that.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, older clients tend to be much more calmed down and relaxed. They don't stress on you as much about being later or not being able to make it, they are usually just appreciative and glad when you are able to make it and they treat you accordingly.</p>
<p>They are just generally more laid-back and polite.</p>
<p>Many older clients are married men, with children well into adulthood.</p>
<p>Usually their wives have long since lost any interest in having a sexual or physically intimate relationship with  their husbands, which is why they seek it out elsewhere.</p>
<p>The reason many end up seeing an escort like myself instead of having an affair with a younger woman is that they have no intention of or desire to abandon their wives and family or cause any drama in their lives.</p>
<p>They just have needs that are not being fulfilled any longer in their marriage and that's why they call me to come visit them.</p>
<p>It's not like these clients have wives who are following them around or spying on them to find out if they are cheating. At that stage in life, they often seem to prefer to just look the other way and not ask questions they might not like the answers for.</p>
<p>These guys have usually spent decades with their spouses and have invested a lot of time and money and love into building a life with that person.</p>
<p>While they enjoy the time they spend with you, they have limited time slots available for meeting and then they have to return to their normal everyday obligations and relationships. </p>
<p>They don't expect any different from you, which is definitely nice!</p>

<h1>Building a List of Regular Clients</h1>
<p>No matter what you are selling, establishing customer loyalty should always be among your top goals and priorities.</p>
<p>When you are just starting out as an escort, you will likely be meeting many new clients. Try to provide the best possible experience for each one you meet and I can pretty much guarantee that every one of them will book you again…and again!</p>
<p>In fact, if you are good at providing the services you choose to offer clients, then it won't take you long to end up with a healthy mixture of regulars who see you according to their various schedules and budgets.</p>

<h2>Different Types of Regulars</h2>
<p>Many of your clients will be upfront with you about wanting to find a provider who they connect with and can see often.</p>
<p>This is why your first encounter with a new client is so crucial.</p>
<p>While some clients will book you less often because they only visit your city for business every so often, local clients who you impress will try to book you several times each month, or even as often as once a week.</p>
<p>Whether a repeat customer books time with you once every three months or calls you every other day to come visit them, they should both be considered regulars with different time constraints and availability.</p>
<p>Clients from out of town who only have a chance to meet with you every so often can usually be counted on and you should do your best to be as reliable as you possibly can for these customers, or you risk losing them to another escort.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are exceptionally good at what you do, then it's not likely that another escort will snag your spot as their first choice.</p>
<p>If your time is in especially high demand and you are not always able to make it for these clients, you may even want to suggest that they have a backup provider in mind just in case you aren't able to make it.</p>
<p>This is always better than trying to take on more than you can realistically handle, leaving your customer waiting around all night for you and missing out on any chance to see someone else if you don't make it.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Relationships Provide Security</h2>
<p>Clients who have specific and regular windows of time in which they can book sessions far out in advance offer some of the stability that you sacrifice when essentially working on a freelance basis.</p>
<p>Like any self-employed entrepreneur knows all too well, life can become difficult very quickly when you do not have a salary you can count on. </p>
<p>As an escort, you can demand an hourly rate that is high enough to easily cover your living expenses and basic needs for an entire month in just one or two encounters rather easily.</p>
<p>But when something unexpected comes up that you don't normally budget for, life can become pretty stressful without warning and being able set aside some extra cash for these situations always beats scrambling to figure things out at the last minute.</p>
<p>Thus, regular and semi-regular clients should always be given priority. It works out well for both you and the client, so work hard to maintain a good track record with them.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Still Advertise</h2>
<p>You may come to the natural conclusion that once you have a nice handful of regular clients, you won't need to advertise your services anymore.</p>
<p>But this isn't the case, at least not until you have been around for some time.</p>
<p>One of the issues I used to run into rather often was that I had too many clients who wanted to see me at any given time and I could only be in one place at one time.</p>
<p>This meant I'd see one of my regulars and two others would miss an opportunity.</p>
<p>When I was available to see them, it didn't seem appropriate for me to contact them and let them know. On very rare occasions, a client would give me the go-ahead and ask me to notify them when I could come over for a visit, but most of them couldn't really have me contacting them whenever it suited me.</p>
<p>When you are posting ads in the same place where a client found you originally, chances are that it's a place they browse often and so they are likely to see if you post a new one once you are available. This gives them the heads up that you are free and that way they can reach you instead.</p>
<p>In my early experience as an escort, I ended up seeing a repeat client probably eight out of ten times I posted a new ad.</p>
<p>And there is never any shortage of new ones, in the rare event that you don't hear from a client who you've seen before. </p>
<p>Personally, I recommend always giving priority to someone who you have had a safe experience with at least once already, rather than take a chance and risk it with a stranger.</p>
<p>Posting ads on a regular basis also keeps you fresh in the minds of all hobbyists who frequent the same websites where you advertise. That includes those who you've seen, as well as ones you haven't but who are interested in booking a session with you.</p>
<p>It's also important to keep in mind that this is an industry where providers often disappear as quickly as they showed up. Many women retire and move on to other jobs or begin a new phase in their life, leaving sex work behind.</p>
<p>So if you go without posting ads for too long, your clients will likely figure you're not providing services any longer which we don't want to happen if you are still looking to make money.</p>

<h1>How to Make Sure Every Client Calls You Back</h1>
<p>Now that we have talked about the importance of building a list of regular clients and the various benefits associated with repeat customers, let's cover how you can ensure that every client you see comes back for more.</p>
<p>So how do you increase the chances that a client will call you back after your first session?</p>
<p>To be honest with you, I don't think most guys are all that difficult to impress when it comes to sex.</p>
<p>As long as you are decent enough and they find you physically appealing, they will probably come back to see you again and probably many times.</p>
<p>However, here are some tips if you want them to be instantly hooked on you like a drug before you part ways the first time.</p>
<p>If you can go the extra mile and really do an outstanding job of the few things listed below, then he will probably be calling you back the next day to setup another meeting.</p>

<h2>Make Them Forget They are Paying</h2>
<p>This really is the most profound and effective way to ensure a client is your regular for years to come. No one likes for sex to feel like a business transaction, even when it technically is.</p>
<p>So while you are in session, make him totally forget that he is paying you.</p>
<p>Convince him that you may as well have been a woman he met in a bar somewhere and flirted with until you both decided to go back to his place for some mutual fun.</p>
<p>Be responsive and have enthusiasm. Both of these will go a long way.</p>
<p>If you act as if the money is an afterthought, you will be his favorite escort after the very first meeting. Guaranteed. </p>
<p>No one likes a "clock watcher" who makes them feel pressured about finishing on time, so don't be one unless a client has earned a reputation for taking advantage of your time.</p>

<h2>Put His Pleasure First</h2>
<p>While most clients want you to enjoy sessions physically and prefer that you are able to let go and get into it with them, we all know that's not going to be possible 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Even when it is possible, sometimes clients get too concerned with your reaction and it can interfere with their own ability to climax.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's easiest to just act the same way you would if you were going through the roof in cases where you know that isn't likely to happen.</p>
<p>This way, they get the same experience and things go more smoothly for them.</p>
<p>And some clients want quicker sessions which are focused only on them, so in those cases just pretend that you are every bit as madly turned on by their pleasure as you would be your own and that should do the trick just fine.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you are there to make them feel good in whatever ways you have agreed to try.</p>
<p>Also important to note is the fact that not all older clients are able to climax, so some won't measure success of a session in the same way or using the same criteria.</p>
<p>It's common for older clients to have medical issues which make it more difficult to sustain an erection, and oftentimes they can't get fully hard or ejaculate no matter what you do to try and get them there.</p>
<p>That's okay though, it's not some shortcoming on your part.</p>
<p>It's just the facts of life and they aren't going to hold it against you or act surprised.</p>

<h2>Keep an Open Mind</h2>
<p>This one is important. While you should again never do anything you are opposed to for any personal reason, it doesn't hurt to at least keep an open mind when working as an escort.</p>
<p>You are definitely going to get all manner of interesting requests for sexual things that you probably never even thought of or considered before a new client asks if you are willing to engage in them.</p>
<p>Firstly, don't be judgmental of guys who ask for things you don't care for or are not willing to do.</p>
<p>As long as their fetish isn't harming anyone else who is unwilling, then they aren't doing anything wrong so don't react negatively or make them feel badly for asking.</p>
<p>Have some class and handle these situations and requests respectfully.</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay to simply tell them something is "not your cup of tea," and that's usually sufficient. They are not likely to push the issue further or ask again in the future.</p>
<p>I don't know about anyone else, but I'm the kind of person who is willing to try almost anything at least once.</p>
<p>I have a very short list of things I absolutely will not do under any circumstances.</p>
<p>However, the list was longer when I began escorting.</p>
<p>Part of that was because of my age, since I was only seventeen when I got started.</p>
<p>Back then, I thought of a lot of things as being taboo that I laugh about now.</p>
<p>That just happens naturally as you get older and more experienced, I suppose.</p>
<p>But it probably has something to do with all the crazy shit I've gotten paid to do with clients since then too! ;-)</p>

<h1>Best Safety Practices for Escorts</h1>
<p>The #1 argument against escorting is the level of danger and risk involved in this type of work. </p>
<p>I'm not going to lie to you because I have no hidden agenda. I want to help women (or men) who are thinking about making money with escorting by sharing my experiences with them and giving them my advice from over ten years in the industry.</p>
<p>However, I only want to help people that are already interested. I have no desire to persuade or "talk you into" becoming a sex worker of any kind.</p>
<p>I feel like it is important to remind readers that my own experience is <u><b>NOT</u></b> representative of the experiences of other escorts, or the majority. I have no way of comparing mine to any other escorts, nor do I have reason to believe that my experiences should be considered normal for the average escort.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm going to just tell you the hard truth right now so we can start accepting it as soon as possible: sex work, particularly prostitution, is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>The murder rate for escorts (or prostitutes, the wording doesn't matter) is higher than that of any other occupation in this country.</p>
<p>This obviously infuriates me, but I think we all can figure out why murderers target (usually women) in this business.</p>
<p>I would love to see the states begin to decriminalize or possibly even legalize prostitution, but we are not quite there yet.</p>
<p>This would make the job so much safer for everyone who chooses to engage in escorting, but I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for it to happen.</p>
<p>However, I can honestly say that I have never once had a violent or dangerous encounter with any of the clients I have seen over the years.</p>
<p>How much of that is luck and how much can be attributed to things I intentionally did to keep myself safe is impossible to say with any certainty.</p>
<p>However, let's talk about some of the things you can do to reduce the risk of running into problems that pose a risk to your health and safety while working as an escort.</p>

<h2>Never Walk the Streets</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important things you should always avoid if you choose to work as an escort. Let's get real for a second --- serial killers like the "Green River Killer" (Gary Ridgeway) targeted streetwalkers for a couple of well-known reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>It was easy to get them in his car.</li><p> After all, they were walking the streets looking for men to pick them up and have sex in exchange for money, right? So luring them to his car would have been super easy, as long as he acted normal and didn't scare them off right away.</p>
<li>No one cared when they went missing.</li><p>This is the worst part about the whole thing. Sex workers are often isolated from family and friends who disown them as a result of their work, which hurts me just to think about. This means that they are not usually surrounded with people who care about them and no one ends up reporting them as missing when they disappear. Sometimes, no one even notices they are gone.</p>
<li>Walking the streets makes you much easier prey.</li><p> Never get into someone's car who you have never spoken to before. Ever. Period.</p>
</ol>
<p>Besides having to worry about dangerous men picking you up and possibly harming you, walking the streets has the added drawback of being hassled by the police or even arrested for loitering or some charge related to prostitution. </p>
<p>Street walking has becoming far less common since widespread use of the internet anyways. I don't honestly know why any women would continue to do it today when there are much safer alternatives, which we are about to cover next.</p>

<h2>Screen New Clients Online</h2>
<p>The internet gives you tons of information about people before you ever meet them, or even respond to their emails or other types of inquiries about booking a meeting with you.</p>
<p>I suggest you use every piece of that information to obtain as much information as you can about the person, to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>For example, if they reach you by email then that means you have an email address to search for on Google and in other places, to see if anything comes up.</p>
<p>Most legitimate hobbyists prefer to be discreet and have obvious concerns about their real names or personal identities becoming known.</p>
<p>This is more a concern about other people finding out than it is about <u><b>YOU</u></b> finding out who they are.</p>
<p>Once they have met with you and know you are safe, they usually don't have any problem with you knowing their name or who they are in real life.</p>
<p>However, before meeting they worry that you could be law enforcement or someone intending to rob them or do something else that would harm them.</p>
<p>For these reasons, many potential clients will have email accounts set up that they use exclusively for the hobby and so oftentimes, it won't help you much in terms of finding out their true identity.</p>
<p>That's okay though.</p>
<p>Often, they will use the same email or username on multiple review boards for providers and so you should still try to Google it, just to see if they are on other sites and to make sure no one has posted any warnings about this user anywhere.</p>
<p>If you get emails from new clients asking to meet you when you haven't recently posted ads anywhere, be suspicious of that immediately.</p>
<p>Ask them where they found your contact information and if they can't answer that, put them on your "no see" list permanently. </p>
<p>If they say they found you profile or an old ad from a particular review board, ask them which one and demand that they share their username on that board so you can check them out.</p>
<p>Members of review boards that have zero reviews should be considered red flags.</p>
<p>It's much better to see a good sized list of reviews. Also, make sure to click through to some of the reviews and also to some of the reviewed providers profiles to make sure they are well known and established.</p>
<p>If a provider has few or no reviews beyond the one you found them through, that's also suspicious. </p>
<p>It's important to just remember that anyone can register an account on a review board, as long as they promise they are of legal age when signing up.</p>
<p>Providers are not required to go through any sort of mandatory verification process on most boards, so in theory someone trying to target sex workers could be posing as both a hobbyist and a provider on the same board, if they are savvy enough.</p>
<p>Also, anyone could register for a review board and then find a hobbyist profile for someone who has posted a lot of reviews and is credible, and then claim they are that user when they email you.</p>
<p>If you are worried about this scenario, ask the person who emailed you to also send you a private message through the review board to make sure they actually control the account.</p>

<h2>Ask for References</h2>
<p>When a new client emails you and offers their username from at least one review board, plus offers you references of providers on that board without being asked, you should feel pretty good about seeing this person.</p>
<p>But always follow up by contacting the provider references they give you.</p>
<p>If they don't give you any, ask for at least one.</p>
<p>Not every client posts reviews or will have any posted when they contact you.</p>
<p>It's your call and only yours as to whether or not you feel comfortable seeing a new client who isn't able to provide references and/or who has not posted any reviews of other providers.</p>
<p>The absence of these things does not automatically mean the client is unsafe to see, but only you can decide who you feel safe meeting in person.</p>
<p>When checking on references, make sure the phone numbers for providers match the ones they use in their ads on whatever review board the client found you through.</p>
<p>Call them up and tell them that this person listed them as a reference. If you have a name for the client, tell them what it is. If not, use their username from the review board or their email address so that the provider can figure out who they are.</p>
<p>If a well-established provider vouches for a new client, it's probably pretty safe to meet with them in person.</p>

<h2>Arrange a Meet and Greet</h2>
<p>Another way to reduce the risk of dangerous clients is to require or request a public "meet and greet" before you book an appointment with them.</p>
<p>A meet and greet means that you agree on a public place where lots of people will be present for your first in-person meeting.</p>
<p>This can be a restaurant, bar or any other place you feel comfortable with meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>The idea is that you meet them in a place where lots of people will see you together.</p>
<p>A client who wishes to do you harm is going to be naturally wary of agreeing to do this.</p>
<p>If you feel a bad vibe from someone after your meet and greet, <u><b>DO NOT</u></b> book an appointment with them.</p>
<p>Always trust your intuition and your gut instinct, even if you can't pinpoint a logical reason why you don't trust them or feel good about meeting them.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of other clients who you can meet with, so don't chance it when you don't need to.</p>

<h2>Have a Trusted Contact</h2>
<p>However you choose to screen clients, you should always have a person you trust who knows where you are going and how long you are supposed to be there before you leave for an appointment with anyone.</p>
<p>You may feel comfortable with a client who you have seen before, but just remember that even those clients could hurt you if they wanted to and so you may want to do this with them too. Better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>This trusted contact needs to be someone close to you who knows the kind of work that you are doing. </p>
<p>I know that many women do not tell anyone they know that they are doing this, but that's a terrible idea. You have to find someone in your life who loves you enough that they will watch out for your well-being and accept your decision to engage in sex work.</p>
<p>Before you leave to meet with any client, you need to give this trusted contact as much information as possible.</p>
<p>The most important details include:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Address</li><p> of where you are going, whether that is the client's residence or some other place</p>
<li>First Time Client?</li><p> someone you have seen several times is generally less risky.</p>
<li>Contact Info</li><p> That includes email address, name, usernames, phone number, the make and model of their car, or anything else that will lead to this person if something goes wrong.</p>
<li>Expected Time of Return</li><p> If the client has booked an hour with you, make sure your trusted contact knows this. Give them a buffer of anywhere between 10-30 minutes max so that you have time to wrap things up if the session goes over an hour and to do the other in-between tasks that are necessary before you have an opportunity to check in with this person.</p>
</ol>
<p>Once you have given them all this, instruct them to call the police or 911 in the event that they do not hear from you and cannot reach you after three attempts once you have been MIA for longer than you should have been.</p>
<p>This way if something goes wrong and you are in a dangerous situation, you know that someone will alert the authorities and call for help if you are not able to. You also have the assurance that they will be able to find you since you provided enough information for your friend to help the police find you.</p>
<p>If something happens with a dangerous client while you are working as an escort, you don't have time to spare. You can't just wait for someone to report you missing after several days of not hearing from you.</p>
<p>This is why it is crucial for someone to have your location information and other details before you go somewhere. </p>
<p>This way, when they call for help they can specifically tell the police you were going to meet a stranger for a first date and that you were supposed to be back already and something must have gone wrong.</p>

<h2>Always be Prepared</h2>
<p>It's also important to be proactive about risks to your physical health while working as an escort. One of the most important thing is to always be prepared ahead of time.</p>
<p>Be sure you stay stocked up on condoms at all times. Never go to meet with a client without them. While some clients are responsible and have them on-hand, you shouldn't rely on this or count on them to have prepared beforehand.</p>
<p>You don't want to wind up without any once you are already there with your client. Usually it's just an inconvenience having to go grab some after the fact, but some clients have small windows of time to spend with you and this will be a bigger problem for some than others.</p>

<h1>Tips for Wrapping Up Long Sessions</h1>
<p>While most clients in my experience have been very respectful of my time, there are occasionally guys who quickly gain reputations for going over time considerably and still expecting to pay only for an hour or however long you agreed to.</p>
<p>These can become bothersome after a while and if you allow it to happen repeatedly, they will think it's acceptable to take advantage of your time each session.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some guys experience problems actually reaching orgasm or just tend to take longer than others to climax.</p>
<p>While this is not an intentional abuse of your time, it still ends up being the same result for you when you think about it.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can handle these clients and situations, so let's talk about those for a moment.</p>

<h2>A Little Dirty Talking Goes a Long Way</h2>
<p>If a client seems to be nearing orgasm and then failing to climax and this happens repeatedly within the same session, they probably just need something to push them over the edge.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean they are not turned on by you, it could be any number of other things.</p>
<p>They might just be struggling with some type of mental block or confidence problem.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to give them that extra nudge in the right direction is to try a little dirty talking.</p>
<p>If you have seen a client more than once, you probably have a pretty good handle on what turns them on so it shouldn't be too hard to think of some naughty little phrase to surprise them with at a moment where they are right on the verge of orgasm.</p>
<p>This drives most guys absolutely wild and they will probably be hooked on you after this.</p>
<p>Some clients will even suggest things for you to say which really turn them on.</p>
<p>But if they don't, just go with your standard stuff you hear in porn movies.</p>
<p>You know, stuff like "Fuck me harder!" or "I want your cum, give it to me please."</p>
<p>These usually work just fine.</p>
<p>I know some escorts are more shy than others. I certainly was when I first started out, so I totally get being timid about dirty talking.</p>
<p>But I promise if you work up the nerve to try this once, the results will probably give you the confidence you need to start doing it more often and with more of your clients.</p>

<h2>Speed Things Up</h2>
<p>I mean this quite literally.</p>
<p>Some guys will intentionally slow you down if they are getting close to reaching orgasm, in an obvious attempt at stretching out the amount of time they get to spend with you.</p>
<p>If someone is clearly doing this over and over and it's starting to really infringe on your time, feel free to ignore them and actually start increasing speed rather than decreasing.</p>
<p>They might protest, but when someone is that close to reaching climax then a few fast strokes will quickly bring them past the point of no return, so they usually have no choice but to give in and enjoy it.</p>

<h2>Enjoy Yourself</h2>
<p>This one may seem obvious, but you should always enjoy your work whenever you can. I've come to the realization that sometimes, for inexplicable reasons, the only reason I wasn't getting into things with a client was because I wasn't letting myself.</p>
<p>I don't know why, it's just a mental block sometimes and there is really no reason to fight pleasure if it shows up, so it's kind of silly.</p>
<p>Relax and enjoy anything that feels good and your client will respond positively to giving you pleasure and will be able to see the authenticity if you just let go and have fun.</p>

<h2>Put on a Convincing Show</h2>
<p>On the other hand, it's not always going to be possible to get into it and enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your mind is on other things or you have personal matters which distract you from the activities during a session.</p>
<p>This is normal, no matter what kind of work you are doing.</p>
<p>Some days are always more of a struggle than others.</p>
<p>So when this is the case, you basically have to put on a show for the client in the same way you would if you had a boss and had to show up for an office job.</p>
<p>You will get better at this over time and after you have some experience under your belt, you will probably win Oscars for your performances.</p>
<p>Obviously if you are in a truly bad place emotionally or mentally, you should address that and take care of yourself first.</p>
<p>Some things can't wait and need to be resolved before you should be seeing clients, so use your best discretion where that is concerned.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that if you don't put a little bit of effort into performing on days when you aren't feeling it, your sessions are likely to drag on longer and your clients won't be as happy after you see them.</p>

<h2>Give Him a Subtle Reminder</h2>
<p>I like to use this as a last resort for those who I consider "problem clients" when it comes to going over the agreed amount of time.</p>
<p>You can do this in a couple of different ways.</p>
<p>One good approach is to let them know ahead of time when they first contact you that you have somewhere to be about an hour after the time they book with you. Use a doctor appointment or something else important so they understand that you have to leave on time or you will be late.</p>
<p>This way they know going into things that once the time is up, it's really over and you need to go.</p>
<p>However, if you must bring it up during a session, then just act like you have all of a sudden become aware of time and ask him to check it for you.</p>
<p>This way it doesn't seem like you are not enjoying yourself or that you think the session is a total drag, but rather that you are concerned about losing track of time.</p>
<p>When he tells you what time it is, just use the same method here by acting surprised and worried and tell him that you didn't realize how much time had passed and that you have somewhere to be very soon that you can't be late for.</p>
<p>This is sometimes necessary and sometimes it will make it even harder for the client to climax, but here's a little secret from me to you: on rare occasions, they just don't end up getting off at all.</p>
<p>It's not like you can devote an entire afternoon to their orgasm when they have paid for one hour of your time. </p>
<p>It may be uncomfortable momentarily, but they will understand and most clients don't have unreasonable expectations to begin with.</p>
<p>Anyone who throws a tantrum over not getting off when you have made your best effort to get them there should go on your "no see" list right away.</p>

<h1>Relevant Side Income for Escorts</h1>
<p>Sex work encompasses a lot more than just escorting, and you can easily make additional side income by dabbling in other types as well.</p>
<p>I've experimented with various related types of sex work and had mixed results.</p>
<p>Here are a few ideas to consider.</p>

<h2>Cam Modelling</h2>
<p>There are tons of websites where you can sign up to work as a webcam model, as long as you are of legal age.</p>
<p>MyFreeCams.com is one of the major webcam model sites where you  can sign up and get started right away.</p>
<p>Invest in a high quality webcam and send in the documentation of your age (usually a photo of your ID, or of you holding it so that they can see it clearly) and login to start modelling.</p>
<p>When you are in the free public cam rooms, you can receive tips from users for doing various things they request. You can also set a room topic and list the number of tokens you require in order to show specific body parts or do specific things of a sexual nature.</p>
<p>You will also need a quiet, private space for cam modelling. You can't have other people appear on camera with you, so make sure you have an appropriate place with enough privacy before you try this out.</p>
<p>You can also set an amount of tokens that have to be received cumulatively from different users viewing your webcam and then do something special for them, like use a sex toy to climax.</p>
<p>This way different users can chip in smaller token amounts to get a good show.</p>
<p>Or you can get a few members to move into private chat with you, where they pay by the minute. I haven't personally done this, so I don't know much about how it works beyond that.</p>
<p>If you want to get an idea of how cam modelling works, go to the site after you are logged in and click on "Most Popular Rooms" and watch other girls on cam who have lots of members viewing them to see what kind of things they do.</p>
<p>As always, the best way to learn is to see what successful people are doing in a particular field. Web cam modelling is no different.</p>
<p>Other optional but recommended things to have for cam modelling are lingerie and some sex toys, like dildos or something similar.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of guys will bombard you with private messages on sites like MyFreeCams and many will ask if you do "Skype shows."</p>
<p>This is where they pay you with tokens through MyFreeCams and the you log off and do a private one-on-one video call with them using Skype. </p>
<p>I've done this before and it works better in my experience than trying to scrounge tips in the free rooms, but I have limited experience with cam modelling overall so you may have different results. </p>

<h2>Sell Digital Content</h2>
<p>Another idea is to make your own explicit videos, photos and other content and then sell them online.</p>
<p>One good site for doing this is ExtraLunchMoney.com.</p>
<p>There, you can sell all of your X-rated digital content for whatever token amount you set.</p>
<p>I have made some money with this website and highly recommend it.</p>
<p>I shoot all my videos with my webcam, so it doesn't cost me anything extra to create content.</p>
<p>Just make sure you have good lighting and that the camera angles are getting all the good stuff.</p>
<p>I also use Camtasia to edit videos after I create them, since there is usually a fair amount of "in between" stuff where I'm re-positioning the camera if I move or switch positions and need to adjust.</p>
<p>It's best to edit that stuff out so you can advertise the video's length and not be misleading to customers who expect non-stop naughtiness throughout the video they are paying for.</p>
<p>Beyond digital content, you can also try your luck with selling physical products as well, such as worn panties or lingerie.</p>
<p>This is another possible way to make extra cash, and you can list your worn panties on ExtraLunchMoney.com as well if you want to try selling them through that platform.</p>
