          <h2>8 Actions You Can Take Today to Help Fight for Abortion Rights</h2>
          <p>I'm sad to report that Roe v Wade is officially dead.</p>
<p>Trump's conservative Supreme Court justices overturned it only days ago, declaring that women do not have a Constitutional right to abortion after 50 years of lived experience that said the complete opposite. </p>
<p>But there is no time to lament what has been lost right now.</p>
<p>There are much more important and useful things you should be focusing your energies on.</p>
<p>I've deep searched the biggest pro life organizations in the USA to get a sense of what they are suggesting for immediate actions that we can all take.</p>
<p>Not all actions to fight for abortion rights are created equally; some of them are more about personal liberation and empowerment than producing tangible results. </p>
<p>So I've decided to start with those things first, and we will work our way up the list to the most crucial actions you can (and absolutely should) take right away.</p>
</p>
		  
		  
		  <ol>
		  <li>Sign Petitions & Pledges</li>
		  <p>Most of the sites in this guide have pledges or petitions you can sign online, which may not carry as much weight as other activities, but it only takes a few minutes to enter your details and submit the forms.</p>
		  <p>It can't hurt, right?</p>

		  
		  <li>Read & Share Abortion Stories</li>
		  <p>The writer in me wants to place this item higher on this list, but doing so wouldn't exactly be prudent. 	 </p>
 <p>We all know the power of a solid narrative. 	 </p>
 <p>Effective storytelling is the key to so many areas of life that seem inaccessible to most people.	 </p>
 <p>It can change lives if it reaches the right people.	 </p>
 <p>So take an hour or two out of your day to sit at your desk with a blank page in front of you, and write a short story about your experience with abortion, then submit it to the websites in this guide. 	 </p>
 <p>Don't let the task intimidate you. 	 </p>
 <p>It doesn't have to be a novel.	 </p>
 <p>The one I wrote was only 229 words (you can read it on the next page if you'd like), so keep it short and sweet!	 </p>
 <p>After you work through all the actions in this guide, come back to your personal story and take some time to research other places that are asking for similar stories.	 </p>
 <p>A lot of shows on National Public Radio (NPR) have been asking for listeners to call in with their personal abortion stories, so do some Googling to see if you can't get some extra exposure out of this.</p>
	
		 </p>
		  <p></p>
		  
		  <li>Talk About Abortion</li>
		  <p> Looking for pre-written content you can quickly copy and paste on sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others?</p>
 <p>Or maybe some attention-grabbing images with important information that others will want to retweet and share with their friends?</p>
 <p>I've got you covered.</p>
 <p>I have scoured the web for these messaging resources and infographics from the amazing pro-choice organizations included in this document.</p>
 <p>I've compiled them all into a giant list, which you can find here.</p>
 <p>However, do NOT limit the discussion to social media or online spaces!</p>
 <p>Abortion isn't an easy topic for everyone</p>
 <p>And that's precisely why it needs to be talked about in person --- with your friends, family members, acquaintances, teachers, classmates, religious leaders, co-workers, colleagues, children --- basically anyone who will listen to what you have to say!</p>
 <p>That's how you remove the stigma from a social issue that never deserved one: you normalize it through the way you discuss it with those close to you.</p>
 <p>And if you're naturally the social butterfly type, then you may want to seriously consider hosting a house party, which this guide will give you links to learn more about as well. </p>

		  
		  
		  
		  
		  <li>Contact Your Reps & VOTE!</li>
		 <p> Out of all the actions suggested by the sites in this guide, the most important and impactful by far is: voting!</p>
 <p>There are plenty of tools in this guide that will help you research the views of the representatives running for election in your state, so you can vote accordingly.</p>
 <p>Vote for progressive candidates (female, when possible!) who have openly endorsed reproductive rights and made a public commitment to doing everything in their power to preserve women's rights.</p>
 <p>On a related note, there are also plenty of resources that will help you contact your local government officials by phone, email and more! </p>
 <p>I don't know about anyone else, but I've been completely unimpressed with the Biden administration's lack of response to this crucial human rights issue so far.</p>
 <p>It's time to bring the heat!</p>
 <p>Don't be shy when reaching out to those running for office where you live.</p>
 <p>Tell them they need to put more pressure on Biden to act.</p>
 <p>He's made it pretty clear that he isn't going to do much on his own, so it's up to us to make it clear that we won't tolerate his silence and we demand more of our President. </p>
		  
		  
		  
		  <li>Attend a Protest or Rally</li>
		   <p>You've probably heard of the Women's Suffrage Movement before.</p>
 <p>Well, let's hope so at least!</p>
 <p>For whatever reason, the female heroes who fought for women's right to vote were masterful at organizing into groups, throwing huge parades for their cause, and when it came to protesting?</p>
 <p>They weren't messing around.</p>
 <p>DID YOU KNOW THAT AMERICAN SUFFRAGISTS PROTESTED IN SHIFTS OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 2 ½ YEARS before finally getting the right to vote?!</p>
	 <p>They called them the Silent Sentinels.</p>
 <p>But it was a rough road getting there.</p>
 <p>Many of them were harassed by onlookers, beaten and ultimately arrested multiple times for manufactured petty crimes like obstructing traffic (LOL)</p>
 <p>Even when they were imprisoned in a workhouse, they used their collective power to do whatever they could to stand up to those with power of authority over them.</p>
 <p>They staged hunger strikes and the prison workers eventually strapped them to chairs, stuck tubes up their noses and force fed them.</p>
 <p>Many decades later, the Civil Rights Movement would borrow many of the tactics employed by the Suffragists to protest for African Americans.</p>

 <p>It always bothers me so much to think that MLK is the well-known and celebrated figure that he is (we have a national holiday for him, FFS) and yet most of us barely know the names of any of the women who endured all those things.</p>
 <p>There are several links and resources in this guide that will help you find an upcoming reproductive rights protest near you.</p>
 <p>Check out what you find in each tool listed here, then add a couple to your calendar when you can set the time aside.</p>
 <p>I went to a rally in Portland, OR a couple years ago and it was a very positive experience.</p>
	  
		  
		  <li>Volunteer</li>
		   <p>If you have the time to spare, consider volunteering locally to support abortion rights.</p>
 <p>There are events taking place in just about every major city across America on nearly a daily (if not, weekly) basis!</p>
 <p>If volunteering is something you feel passionately about, you should have no trouble finding an abundance of opportunities.</p>
 <p>And remember that not all volunteering has to be local - there are calls for remote volunteering too.</p>
		  
		  <li>Expose Fake Clinics</li>
		   <p>Pregnancy "resource" centers mislead women into thinking they are abortion clinics when that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
 <p>They pay to run Google ads that show up when someone searches for phrases like "abortion clinic near me" and present themselves as actual medical facilities.</p>
 <p>They are NOT.</p>
 <p>They just want to get you in their door so they can guilt, shame and hopefully talk you out of getting an abortion.</p>
 <p>They are sleazy liars who misrepresent the services they offer, which barely even exist.</p>
 <p>Does that make you as angry as it does me?!</p>
 <p>Let's participate in exposing them for what they are. </p>
 <p>We can easily do this by contacting them and finding out how dishonest they are by pretending to be a pregnant person looking for abortion services.</p>
 <p>Once you catch them in a lie, head over to Google and Yelp and write a brief one star review.</p>
 <p>While you're there, don't forget to upvote all the other one star reviews to really ruin their reputations.</p>

		  
		  
		  <li>Donate to Abortion Funds</li>
		   <p>If you can afford to, please consider donating to your local abortion fund or one in a different state!</p>
 <p>These are organizations and groups that connect people in need of abortion care with the resources they need, whether that means travelling out of state, or getting financial assistance to receive care near home.</p>
